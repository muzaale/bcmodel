Teams Channel. For grading questions (such as regrade request and late
submission), you can initiate private chats with the TAs. Admin issues
should be directed to Dr. Caffo.

I cannot stress enough the need to be active on Teams for the class.
Much of the discussion will occur there. New announcements will be made
there. For important announcements I will @ the class.

# **Grading:**

-   3^rd^ term There will be once weekly online homework submissions due
    Mondays at 5:00 PM, unless it is a school holiday. These will be
    based on 100 points and your percentage of total points will
    represent 100% of the grade. The specific format of the evaluation
    will be communicated each week.

-   4^th^ term same as 3^rd^ term except HW and a final project that
    accounts for 40% of the grade (so 60% HW and 40% final project).

-   Please put your name on your submitted materials. In the first text
    block of an ipynb file, the top lines of a text or MD file or in a
    top comment of a python code file. Please make sure that your
    submitted name agrees with your JHED name (or put both so we can
    properly attribute).

-   If you need to submit an assignment late, do the following steps: 1)
    message Brian (on Teams) to get approval 2) when you submit the
    assignment to GH classroom message the TA grading that assignment
    **with the link to the repo**. Also, please follow up with the TA if
    you have not received a grade for a late submission within one week.

-   Grades will be recorded and distributed on Teams. **Please make sure
    that you have received a grade for assignments submitted when we
    announce that the assignment has been graded.**

-   Any late submission graded without approval will have a 10 point
    penalty.

-   **All grades are final when grades are submitted**, and missing
    grades will be given a value of 0. The policy on grade changes is
    *"Once an instructor has submitted a grade to the Homewood
    Registrar, grade changes can be made only in the case of error in
    grading, calculation, or transcription."*

-   Project due date in the 4^th^ term is firm. Please consider that
    when working on it.

-   Grades due third term 3/31/2023, 6/2/2023

-   Note for graduating seniors, fourth term grades are due 5/19/2023.
    Because of this, the project deadline is firm for graduating
    seniors.

**Homework rules**

-   To reiterate, put your name in the text of every file. (So, in the
    top text block of an ipynb or the top line of a md file or the top
    line of a text file ...) Otherwise, we have no way of associating
    your github username with your actual name. Please make sure the
    name you give agrees with the one in the JHED system (or put both).

-   Every evaluation is open book, open internet \....

-   You may consult with fellow students on any assignment. However,
    please do so on Teams. All work submitted must be your own. Copying
    or plagiarism will be considered a breach of student conduct.

-   If doing a team capstone project, separate github submissions must
    be made and the role of each team member delineated in the readme
    file.

-   AI based submissions are not allowed. However, feel free to use AI
    (chat-gpt for example) as a resource.

# **Fourth term final project** There is no project at the end of third term. However, the fourth term includes a final project. 

-   # You should hand in the code for a data web app that you create based on an application of your interest.

-   # The project includes a 5 minute (maximum) video and one page (maximum) markdown readme file describing your project. Your MD readme file should include a link to the video that I can see or the video included in the repo.

-   # You name should be on your readme file, in the project video and in all code files as comments.

-   # This project can be done in a group up to size 5. 

-   # Every project member must submit a repository.

-   #  The project due date is extremely firm for graduating seniors.

-   # Here's the github classroom assignment link 

# <https://classroom.github.com/a/V-Ayz7c2>

-   #  Grading Rubric

    -   #  The project must involve data, analysis -- it can be prediction, regression, whatever, it has to involve data at some level (project will be rejected if this condition is failed to be met) 

    -   # There must be a dash / shiny or streamlit app (the project will be rejected if this condition is not met)

    -   Each team must submit a write up in the form of your readme
        file, and a 5 minute video (the project will be rejected if this
        condition is not met).

    -   Then the project will be graded on:

        -   Is the app documented with instructions on use

        -   Effort, points will be deducted for low effort projects
            (like a simple BMI calculator or something like that)

        -   Correctness of results -- was the data treated
            appropriately, was it cleaned appropriately, are there large
            conceptual or practical errors

        -   Communication -- was the app well presented, do I have a
            sense of what it's doing, is the web site and readme well
            presented?

# **Development environments**

Students tend to like to use their own IDEs. However, we have a class
jupyter server

<https://jupyter.biostat.jhsph.edu/hub/login?next=%2Fhub%2F>

Message Brian for access.

In addition github codespaces are setup as well

Finally, google colab is OK, but you should work towards one of these
other solutions as you go

All video passwords are **ds4ph-2023**
