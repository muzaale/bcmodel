    "The number of older adults (aged<55) undergoing live donor nephrectomy has quadrupled over the last two decades and this trend is likely to continue. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the resiliencies to physical stress in older donors. Beyond age-related vulnerability to surgical stress, this aging population may have significant glomerular senescence, an inadequate adaptive response to the 50% loss of nephron mass and, as such, a very high likelihood of CKD in their lifetime. Approximately 80% of older donors have a postdonation GFR<60 ml/min/1.73m2 and meet the standard definition of CKD. \n",
    "\n",
    "As older donors progress towards CKD, they are likely to become frail and, as such, at increased risk of hospitalization. No study has focused on the identification of clinical signatures of resiliency in older persons undergoing live donor nephrectomy. The renal system is directly impacted by nephrectomy and its resiliency may affect the health and well-being of older donors. Provider discussions with these potential donors should focus on the patient's most important question: **Can I safely donate my kidney??** not the population-level question asked by the 2017 KDIGO guidelines: How many ESRD events in younger donors may be averted by transplanting older donors instead. I propose the following scientific aims: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To quantify donation-attributable risk of ESRD and mortality in older donors; \n",
    "2. To describe the prevalence of hospitalizations in older donors vs. older nondonors; and,\n",
    "3. To <u>implement a risk calculator</u> for ESRD, **mortality** and sentinel hospitalization in older donors. In brief, I'm in the third year of a PhD in Clinical Investigation Program at Bloomberg School. My efforts in this class are culminating in the creation of online risk calculators that inform the conversation between candidates and providers about the propriety of donation. I will deploy several other calculators to reflect my other outcomes of importance to donors other than mortality.\n",
